## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this challenge I practiced:

* Using **CSS Grid and Flexbox** together to create a responsive layout.
* Switching images for **mobile and desktop** using media queries (`.desktop` and `.mobile`).
* Creating reusable **CSS variables** for colors and typography.
* Implementing hover states for buttons with smooth transitions.

Here is an example of the CSS variable setup I used:

```css
:root {
  --Green500: hsl(158, 36%, 37%);
  --Green700: hsl(158, 42%, 18%);
  --Black: hsl(212, 21%, 14%);
  --Grey: hsl(228, 12%, 48%);
  --Cream: hsl(30, 38%, 92%);
  --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
}
```

### Continued development

For future projects I want to focus more on:

* Improving semantic HTML structure by using `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<figure>` tags.
* Making images responsive without having to switch manually between two `<img>` tags.
* Exploring accessibility improvements such as better alt text and ARIA roles.
